# 2019 Goals

Like many, I have a few things I'd like to achieve in the new year. Here's a public record of what I aim to build and launch.
- [ ] Nontech School - A hands-on training course demonstrating how to break into tech without learning to code
- [ ] Bootstrap Advisory - Network of board members to support and advise bootstrappers, indie hackers, and solo founders
- [ ] State of No-Code Report - Mary Meeker's Internet Trends meets Marketing Technology Landscape graphic
- [ ] Monthly Startup Review - Take a stab at finding, highlighting, and projecting futures of promising companies and their markets
